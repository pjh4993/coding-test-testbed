"""Number of Islands (Graph Traversal).

Given a m x n grid of '0' (water) and '1' (land), count the number of islands.
An island is surrounded by water and formed by connecting adjacent lands (4-directionally).

Example:
Input:
grid = [
 ["1","1","0","0"],
 ["1","0","0","1"],
 ["0","0","1","1"],
 ["0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 3

Hint:
Use DFS or BFS flood-fill to mark visited cells.

Grade:
Easy-Medium
