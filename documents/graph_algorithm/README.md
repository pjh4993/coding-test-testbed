Great question üëç ‚Äî having a **structured ideation flow** when you see a graph algorithm problem helps reduce panic and gives you a systematic approach. Here‚Äôs a framework you can follow in coding tests:

---

## 1. **Understand the Graph Type**

Ask yourself:

* Is it **directed** or **undirected**?
* Is it **weighted** or **unweighted**?
* Is it **dense** or **sparse**?
* Is it given as an **adjacency list, matrix, or edge list**?

üëâ This step determines whether you should lean toward BFS/DFS, Dijkstra, Union-Find, or something else.

---

## 2. **Identify the Core Problem Pattern**

Common categories:

* **Traversal** ‚Üí Reachability, connectivity (BFS, DFS).
* **Shortest Path** ‚Üí Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall.
* **Cycle Detection** ‚Üí Union-Find, DFS.
* **Topological Ordering** ‚Üí Kahn‚Äôs algorithm or DFS.
* **Minimum Spanning Tree** ‚Üí Kruskal, Prim.
* **Flow / Matching** (advanced) ‚Üí Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp.

üëâ Classifying the problem avoids brute-forcing.

---

## 3. **Check Constraints**

* Number of nodes (`n`) and edges (`m`).
* Is `n` large (10^5 or more)? ‚Üí Use adjacency lists and O(n log n) algorithms.
* Is `n` small (<500)? ‚Üí Matrix-based approaches (Floyd-Warshall) are fine.
* Are weights small integers? ‚Üí BFS with deque (0-1 BFS) may be possible.

üëâ Constraint-driven thinking narrows choices.

---

## 4. **Design the Approach**

* Start with the **simplest traversal (BFS/DFS)** if no weights are involved.
* If **weights are positive**, consider **Dijkstra with a heap**.
* If **negative weights**, check for Bellman-Ford.
* If asking about **"all pairs shortest paths"**, think Floyd-Warshall (small n).
* If problem is about **components or connectivity**, think Union-Find.

---

## 5. **Edge Cases & Pitfalls**

* Empty graph, isolated nodes.
* Graph with cycles vs. DAGs.
* Multiple edges, self-loops.
* Large weights ‚Üí watch for overflow.
* Disconnected components.

---

## 6. **Translate Into Code Skeleton**

Have a reusable template for:

* **Adjacency list construction**.
* **DFS/BFS** template.
* **Dijkstra/Heap** template.
* **Union-Find** boilerplate.

üëâ This saves time and avoids silly mistakes.

---

## 7. **Debug With Small Examples**

Before running on big test cases:

* Draw a small graph (5‚Äì6 nodes).
* Manually trace BFS/DFS or shortest path.
* Compare your algorithm‚Äôs output.

---

‚úÖ **Summary Flow**:

1. Parse input ‚Üí Build graph structure.
2. Identify problem type (traversal / path / cycle / spanning tree).
3. Match with known algorithm template.
4. Consider constraints (optimize if needed).
5. Code with reusable skeleton.
6. Test with a toy example.

---

Would you like me to **make a one-page "cheat sheet" with mini-templates (Python skeletons)** for BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, Union-Find, and Topological Sort, so you can quickly apply them in coding tests?

---

Got it ‚úÖ ‚Äî here‚Äôs a **Python code skeleton with reusable templates** for the most common graph algorithms you might need in coding tests. You can copy-paste these and adapt them quickly.

---

## 1. **Graph Construction**

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque
import heapq

# Adjacency list construction
def build_graph(n, edges, directed=False, weighted=False):
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v, *w in edges:
        if weighted:
            weight = w[0]
            graph[u].append((v, weight))
            if not directed:
                graph[v].append((u, weight))
        else:
            graph[u].append(v)
            if not directed:
                graph[v].append(u)
    return graph
```

---

## 2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**

```python
def bfs(graph, start):
    visited = set([start])
    queue = deque([start])
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        # Process node here
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)
```

---

## 3. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**

```python
def dfs(graph, start, visited=None):
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()
    visited.add(start)
    # Process node here
    for neighbor in graph[start]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            dfs(graph, neighbor, visited)
```

```python
def dfs_iterative(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    stack = [start]

    while stack:
        node = stack.pop()
        if node in visited:
            continue
        visited.add(node)

        # Process the node here
        # print(node)

        # Push neighbors to stack
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                stack.append(neighbor)
    return visited
```


---

## 4. **Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm (Shortest Path)**

```python
def dijkstra(n, edges, src):
    graph = build_graph(n, edges, directed=True, weighted=True)
    dist = [float('inf')] * n
    dist[src] = 0
    heap = [(0, src)]  # (distance, node)

    while heap:
        d, u = heapq.heappop(heap)
        if d > dist[u]:
            continue
        for v, w in graph[u]:
            if dist[v] > d + w:
                dist[v] = d + w
                heapq.heappush(heap, (dist[v], v))
    return dist
```

---

## 5. **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union - DSU)**

```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.parent = list(range(n))
        self.rank = [0] * n

    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])  # Path compression
        return self.parent[x]

    def union(self, x, y):
        rootX, rootY = self.find(x), self.find(y)
        if rootX == rootY:
            return False  # Cycle detected
        if self.rank[rootX] < self.rank[rootY]:
            self.parent[rootX] = rootY
        elif self.rank[rootX] > self.rank[rootY]:
            self.parent[rootY] = rootX
        else:
            self.parent[rootY] = rootX
            self.rank[rootX] += 1
        return True
```

---

## 6. **Topological Sort (Kahn‚Äôs Algorithm - BFS)**

```python
def topo_sort(n, edges):
    graph = build_graph(n, edges, directed=True)
    indegree = [0] * n
    for u in graph:
        for v in graph[u]:
            indegree[v] += 1

    queue = deque([i for i in range(n) if indegree[i] == 0])
    order = []

    while queue:
        u = queue.popleft()
        order.append(u)
        for v in graph[u]:
            indegree[v] -= 1
            if indegree[v] == 0:
                queue.append(v)

    return order if len(order) == n else []  # Empty if cycle exists
```

---

‚úÖ With these six templates, you can handle most graph-related problems: connectivity, cycle detection, shortest paths, MST, scheduling, and traversal.

---

Would you like me to also include a **one-page cheat sheet (Markdown or PDF)** where each of these is written very compactly (no comments, just the essential skeletons), so you can use it as a quick reference during practice?
