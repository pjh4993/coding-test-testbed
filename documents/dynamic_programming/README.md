Great question — having a **clear approach to DP problems** is what separates “knowing the solution” from being able to solve *any* new DP problem you see in an interview. Here’s a structured **ideation flow** you can follow:

---

## 🔹 1. Understand the Problem

* Restate the problem in **your own words**.
* Identify if the problem is about:

  * **Optimization** (min/max something, e.g., min cost path).
  * **Counting ways** (number of paths, number of subsequences).
  * **Decision-making** (true/false, can we achieve X?).

👉 If it feels like the problem can be broken into smaller overlapping subproblems → it’s a DP candidate.

---

## 🔹 2. Identify States

Ask yourself:

* What parameters define the problem at any point?
* Usually, **indices (i, j)**, **remaining capacity**, or **substrings** form states.

For example:

* Fibonacci: state is just `n`.
* Coin change: state is `(amount)`.
* Edit distance: state is `(i, j)` representing prefixes of the two strings.

---

## 🔹 3. Define the Recurrence (Transition)

Think: *How can I build the answer from smaller states?*

* What decisions can I make at each step?
* How do those decisions reduce the problem into smaller subproblems?

Example (Climbing Stairs):
`dp[n] = dp[n-1] + dp[n-2]`

Example (House Robber):
`dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i])`

---

## 🔹 4. Base Cases

Every DP starts with trivial answers:

* Fibonacci: `dp[0] = 0, dp[1] = 1`
* Coin Change: `dp[0] = 0` (0 coins to make 0 amount).
* Edit Distance: `dp[i][0] = i` (all deletions).

👉 Base cases prevent infinite recursion.

---

## 🔹 5. Choose the DP Style

* **Top-Down (Memoization)**: Write recursion + cache results.
* **Bottom-Up (Tabulation)**: Build iteratively using arrays.
* **Space Optimization**: Reduce from 2D → 1D if only last row/column is needed.

👉 Start with recursion + memoization for clarity. Switch to bottom-up for performance.

---

## 🔹 6. Complexity Analysis

* **Time:** Usually (#states × work per state).
* **Space:** Table size (optimize if possible).

Example (Edit Distance):
States = O(m × n), Work per state = O(1) → O(mn).

---

## 🔹 7. Test on Small Examples

* Dry-run with tiny inputs (n=2, n=3).
* Debug transitions if the result doesn’t match.

---

## 🔹 8. Recognize Patterns

Most DP problems fall into a few **templates**:

1. **1D Linear DP** → Fibonacci, House Robber.
2. **2D Grid DP** → Unique paths, Min path sum.
3. **Knapsack Variants** → Subset sum, coin change.
4. **Sequence Alignment** → Edit distance, LCS.
5. **Intervals** → Matrix chain multiplication, palindrome partitioning.

👉 Once you map a problem to a known template, it gets much easier.

✅ **Cheat-Flow for Interviews**

1. Identify **states** (What parameters define the problem?).
2. Write **recurrence** (How do smaller problems build bigger ones?).
3. Set **base cases**.
4. Decide **top-down or bottom-up**.
5. Optimize if needed.

Would you like me to create a **visual flowchart** for this DP problem-solving approach, so you can keep it as a quick reference during prep?
