Great question 🙌
When tackling **Hashing & Data Structures problems** in coding tests, it helps to follow a **structured ideation flow** so you don’t get stuck. Here’s a practical **approach framework** you can use:

---

# 🔑 Ideation Flow for Hashing & Data Structure Problems

## 1. **Understand the Problem Shape**

* Ask: *Am I dealing with elements, substrings, subarrays, or key-value lookups?*
* Typical clues:

  * **Lookup/search** → Hash map / Hash set
  * **Counting frequency** → Hash map
  * **Group by property** → Hash map with a list as value
  * **Window constraints** → Sliding window + Hash map/set
  * **Order matters** → Linked list / OrderedDict
  * **Prefix / Suffix patterns** → Hash map with prefix/suffix sums

---

## 2. **Identify Constraints**

* **Time complexity requirements** often hint the data structure:

  * O(1) average lookup → Hash map/set
  * O(log n) with ordering → TreeMap / Heap
  * Stream processing → Hash + window
* **Memory limits**: Avoid storing huge intermediate states (optimize key representation, like tuples instead of full strings).

---

## 3. **Pick the Right Hashing Strategy**

* **Direct hash** → store elements themselves (e.g., `seen = set()`).
* **Mapping counts** → store frequency (`collections.Counter` or dict).
* **Mapping states** → store prefix sums, encoded states, or sorted signatures.
* **Composite keys** → tuples, frozenset, or strings as dict keys.

---

## 4. **Apply a Standard Pattern**

Most interview problems fall into these **hashing/data structure archetypes**:

1. **Existence Check**
   ➝ Does an element/combination exist?
   *Tool:* Hash set (e.g., Two Sum, detect duplicates).

2. **Counting / Frequency**
   ➝ How many occurrences of X?
   *Tool:* Hash map (e.g., Subarray Sum Equals K, word frequency).

3. **Grouping**
   ➝ Group elements with the same signature.
   *Tool:* Hash map with list values (e.g., Group Anagrams).

4. **Sliding Window with Hashing**
   ➝ Maintain state of a dynamic window.
   *Tool:* Hash map/set + two pointers (e.g., Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters).

5. **Caching / Eviction**
   ➝ Maintain limited size with O(1) access + eviction policy.
   *Tool:* Hash map + linked list / OrderedDict (e.g., LRU/LFU cache).

---

## 5. **Validate with Examples**

* Always test on:

  * **Base case** (empty, single element).
  * **Typical case** (mixed values).
  * **Edge case** (duplicates, negatives, long strings, etc).

---

## 6. **Analyze Complexity**

* Time: Hash map/set → O(1) average per operation.
* Space: Usually O(n) to store keys/values, but watch out for problem constraints.

---

# ⚡ Example Application

**Problem:** Subarray Sum Equals K

* Step 1: Subarray sum → prefix sums
* Step 2: Need to know if `(curr_sum - k)` appeared before → hash map lookup
* Step 3: Store frequency of prefix sums
* Pattern: **Counting with hash map**
* Complexity: O(n) time, O(n) space

✅ With this flow, you’ll have a checklist to quickly map new problems to known strategies.

Would you like me to also make you a **cheat sheet table** (Problem Pattern → Data Structure + Hashing Strategy + Example Problem) so you can review quickly before interviews?
